This repository contains the code used for the paper "Observation-based Simulations of Humidity and Temperature Using Quantile Regression" by Andrew Poppick and Karen A. McKinnon. Code is not production quality and will need modifications to run on your machine.

- ./analysis contains the code used to estimate the statistical models, produce the simulations, and create the figures shown in the paper.

- ./get_GSOD_USA/ contains the code used to download GSOD station data used for the simulations

- ./get_LENS_data/ contains code used to calculate daily average temperature and dew point in CESM-LE over the region studied.
